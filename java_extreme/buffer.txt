The beauty of buffers
If there were no buffers, it would be like shopping without a cart. Youd have
to carry each thing out to your car.

Buffers give you a temporary holding place to group things until the holder
(like the cart) is full. You get to make far fewer trips when you use a buffer


"Boulder" => (is written to) => "Boulder" "Aspen" "Denver" BufferedWriter
=>(is chained to) => "Aspen Denver Boulder" When the buffer is full, the
Strings are all written to FileWriter (a connection stream that writes
charac as opposed to bytes) => (destination to a file) Aspen /n 
Denver /n Boulder

BufferedWRiter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(aFile));
